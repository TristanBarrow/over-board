5. Describe the features that are not yet working correctly.

The ui has zero styling. Some of the client side DOM manipulation still needs to be finished.

D - Meets requirements

7. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.

I think its coming together quite well. I am doing some kinda sneaky stuff with my client side js and DOM manipulation.
I am starting to test my app. I love the structure of the app. I am really enjoying this one.

8. Please list any questions you have for the instructor regarding this assignment or this week's topic.

Last week I was told to not create a new pool connection for each request. I didn't think that was happening.
I put the pool connection on the req object so I only make one in my whole app so I think that should solve it.
If I should do something different let me know.
