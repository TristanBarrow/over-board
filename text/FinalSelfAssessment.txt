7. (Optional) Any other comments about the project?

I worked really hard on this project. I love this project and this subject and I put alot of different technologies into it and learned
a very deep and wide range of things this semester from becoming a beginner at Docker to finally understanding the idea
of a REST API.

Used Tech:
PSQL
Bash (Just some very small Bash scripts)
Node JS
Express
jQuery
Sass (SCSS)
React JS
Babel
Webpack
Git (Hardly Counts)

Almost used:
Jest testing Framework (setup I just haven't writen any tests yet)
Docker (I had an image setup but util I understand it better its easier without it)
